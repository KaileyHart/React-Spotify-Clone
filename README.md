# React Spotify Clone

## Description
This is a responsive React App that replicates the Spotify Web App UI and some functionalities, such as play and skip. It was created using React, React Context, [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api), and [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/).

The user will already have to have a Spotify account to log in since user authentication is taken care of by the Spotify API. The app functionalities will only work if the user has Spotify premium, the UI will still work if the user has a free account with Spotify.

## Deployment

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
